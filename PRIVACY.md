**Effective date:** 2025-11-11
**Extension name:** Universal Dark Mode Toggle  
**Developer:** Tony Dong  

## Overview
Universal Dark Toggle is a lightweight browser extension that enables or disables dark mode on websites with one click. It is designed for convenience and accessibility.

## Data Collection and Usage
- **No personal data is collected.**  
- **No data is transmitted to any server.**  
- **No analytics, tracking, or third-party integrations** are used.  
- All extension operations occur entirely within your browser.

## Permissions
This extension uses the following Chrome permissions:
- `activeTab` — to inject the dark-mode script into the current page when toggled.  
- `scripting` — to safely apply or remove dark mode styles.  

Note: The extension uses standard web localStorage to remember your dark-mode preference locally.
This is handled entirely by your browser and does not require the Chrome storage permission.
No data leaves your device.
